how_sum(8, [2, 3, 5]) => [3, 5]

how_sum(7, [2, 4]) => None

how_sum(0, [1, 2, 3]) => how is target sum of zero trivially solved?
                      => []

example:
    how_sum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7])

                   7
            -5  -3  -4  -7
            2   4   3   0

            2 can't go further - should return null
            4 will lead to a valid sum
            3 will also lead to a valid sum
            7 already has reached target

            so these return values should return to parent, where the parent
            should also append itself to the value

            4 could subtract 3, so now the target is 1, which leads to null
            but 4 will lead to target reached

            so the parent will need to accept null and arrays
            and the array needs to override the null

            so combinations are encoded as a path of edges

    say m is target sum
    and n is array length

    Time: O(n^m)
    Space: O(m) - stack space, also the array returned which is also m-size

    MEMOIZED version:
    Time: O(n*m)
    Space: O(m)? Wait, consider the MEMO object.
            Maximal length of any array is length m
            There are m keys
            So m keys * m length array
