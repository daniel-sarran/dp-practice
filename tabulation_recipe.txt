Tabulation Recipe

- Visualize the problem as a table
- Size the table based on the inputs
    e.g. Fibonacci of n, we made the table n elements long
    e.g. Grid Traveler, represents a grid, we had to create a 2-dimensional
         table
- Initialize the table with default values
    e.g. if you return a number, initialize with a number
    e.g. if you return a boolean, consider True or False
- Iterate through the table
- Fill further positions based on the current position
